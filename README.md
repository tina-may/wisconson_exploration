# Data Exploration Notebook: Call Center Data Analysis  

## Overview  
This notebook performs an exploratory analysis of call center data, classifying complaints by type using **regex keyword matching** and extracting ZIP codes from location descriptions. It then visualizes the frequency of complaint types across different ZIP codes.  

---

## **Data Sources**  
To run, place data csv's in the data directory
1. **`callcenterdatacurrent.csv`** – Recent call records  
2. **`callcenterdatahistorical.csv`** – Historical call records  

## **Plots**  
Each plot shows the call frequencies for each zipcode within a category. City planners can use this information to allocate appropriate resources to these areas

## **Future Work** 
- More finegrained and inclusive categories for the call classification
- Creating a map visualization to better show the spacial commonalities of problem zones
